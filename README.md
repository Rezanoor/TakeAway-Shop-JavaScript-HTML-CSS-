Memo: Website Requirements
From: Management of Tak3Away, Private Limited.
To : WIMP Engineering R&D Consultants
Specification
Design and develop a web based self-service ordering system for Tak3Away. The idea is to allow customers to place their order through a web browser. Upon confirming their order and after checking out from the web self-service ordering system, the customer can at their leisure drive or walk-in into one of the specified take-away outlets to collect their order.
Resources
Resources such as images and a price list of food items can be found in PRORESOURCE.ZIP. The content of the ZIP file is:
1. Resource List.pdf – an index of all the images with relevant details of associated filenames, price list and location of outlets.
2. Food Pictures folder – Folder of 20 food images.
3. Outlet.png – an image indicating the four different take-away outlets.
4. Tak3AwayLogo.png – image of Tak3Away logo.

across several webpages. The idea is to ensure that customers are made aware of the complete selection of food items available at Tak3Away.
4. The images are to be used as it is. You can resize the images retaining the original aspect ratio, but do not crop or edit (e.g. recolour, touch up, sharpen, etc.) or rename the images in any way.
5. Upon completing the order and on check-out process from the website, the customer is presented with an image of the location of the four available outlets. Prompt the customer to select which outlet they prefer to collect their meal. Customers must select one and only one outlet.
